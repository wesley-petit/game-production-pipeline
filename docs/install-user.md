## Installation

### P4V Client

1. Download and install [P4V](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v).

2. In P4V, enter the address and the username given by your Helix Core Server administrator.

It has 3 main pane :

- **Toolbar** : Provides quick access to a subset of actions and tools available from the menu bar. To get information about a toolbar item or other object in P4V, move the mouse pointer over the object. P4V displays a small window (tooltip) containing status or explanatory information about the object. P4V makes extensive use of tooltips.

- **Left pane** : Includes the following tabs:
  - **Depot Tree** : Shows all of the files in the depot.
  - **Workspace Tree** : Shows the files on your computer, including files that are not in the depot

- **Right pane** : Contains tabs for working with changelists, labels, workspaces, users, jobs, streams, and branches.

### Get the project
